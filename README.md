## My work
cross-city_LST.js is document modified to implement Sofia Ermida's code to my [cross-city ecosystem services project](https://github.com/zule-lab/CrossCityES) 
- modules found on L19 of this code 'users/icrichmond/cross-city-es:SofiaErmidaModules/Landsat_LST' are the same modules in `modules/` folder in this repo 
- code to produce assets can all be found in my cross-city ES repository: [MunicipalBoundariesCleaned](https://github.com/zule-lab/CrossCityES/blob/main/scripts/2b-RoadsCleanup.R) , [AllNeighbourhoodsCleaned](https://github.com/zule-lab/CrossCityES/blob/main/scripts/2a-NeighbourhoodsCleanup.R), and [RoadsCleaned](https://github.com/zule-lab/CrossCityES/blob/main/scripts/2b-RoadsCleanup.R)
